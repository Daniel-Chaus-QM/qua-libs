# Pound Locking Method for Super Conducting Resonators Characterization

This Example implements Pound locking technique for superconducting micro-resonators characterization

What is pound locking and how are we implementing it on superconducting resonators

The Example consists of three stages:
1. Pound Drever Hall Spectroscopy
2. Basic PID which locks on the resonator frequency and shows the detuning from a starting guess
3. Cross Correlation noise analyzer code 

It is possible to simulate each one of the stages at the base frequency (IF)
